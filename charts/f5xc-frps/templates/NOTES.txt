**Sample frpc config**
Note: *serverAddr* must be changed to the public endpoint of the frp server
Note: *name*, *localIP*, and *localPort* must be adjusted to reflect the proxied application

serverAddr = "frpstcp.example.com" # the domain name exposed by the XC TCP LB
serverPort = {{ .Values.bindPort }} # the port exposed by the TCP LB in XC
transport.tls.enable = false # this needs to be fixed
log.level = "trace" # this can be set to debug info or warning
log.to = "console" # if this is anything other than 'console' logs will not be available via the XC console
auth.method = "token"
auth.token = "{{ .Values.authToken }}"

[[proxies]]
name = "compose_test_web"
type = "http"
localIP = "web" # this is the name of the docker compose service
localPort = 5000 # this is the port exposed by the container NOT the host port exposed by docker
customDomains = ["{{ include "f5xc-frps.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}"] # this is the service name and namespace in XC
